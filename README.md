_Query Resolving ChatBot_
This project presents a product-based chatbot on fictionated skincare brand company named Nuria. the chabot named Neo, that utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approach to resolve queries. The chatbot is built using Python and implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, leveraging the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and Keras libraries.

The chatbot is designed to interact with users in natural language, providing accurate and relevant responses to product-related queries. The RNN architecture employed is a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, which is further enhanced with an attention mechanism to improve performance.

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of RNNs in building conversational AI systems, particularly in product-based chatbots. The use of NLTK enables efficient text preprocessing, while Keras provides a flexible and accessible framework for building and training the RNN model.

The chatbot is trained on a dataset of product-related queries and responses to improve its responses over time. The implementation in Python and Jupyter Notebook provides a flexible and accessible framework for development and testing.
